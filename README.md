# Space Search

This my first application I made using React with TypeScript.

It is a place where you can lookup and store images from NASA.

Google FireStore is used for authentication, storing user data and hosting

# NASA APIs Used:

APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day)

DSCOVR's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument

Mars Rover Photos
